# CRC Generator

This project encompasses a C language tool designed for generating a range of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes. CRC is a widely utilized method for error detection in data transmission and storage. The program implements a structured approach to define parameters for multiple CRC algorithms and provides the functionality to compute CRC values.

Features:

• Supports up to 21 different CRC standards.

• Includes CRC algorithms ranging from 4 to 32 bits.

• Handles both standard and non-standard initial values, polynomials, and reflected bit operations.
  Offers flexible input by allowing the selection of different CRC algorithms through modifying an enumeration value in the code.
  
• Custom Parameter Definition - Enhances the tool by allowing users to define custom parameters for generating CRC codes. 
  This includes the ability to specify unique polynomial values, initial values, and control over bit reflection operations, enabling more tailored and specific CRC calculations according to user requirements.
