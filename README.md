# CRC Generator

This project contains a C language tool for generating various cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes. CRC is a popular technique used for detecting errors in data transmission or storage. The program implements a structured way to define parameters for multiple CRC algorithms and offers the functionality to compute CRC values.

Features
Supports up to 21 different CRC standards.
Includes CRC algorithms ranging from 4 to 32 bits.
Handles standard and non-standard initial values, polynomials, and reflected bit operations.
Offers flexible input by allowing the selection of different CRC algorithms through modifying an enumeration value in the code.
